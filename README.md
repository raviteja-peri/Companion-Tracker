# Companion-Tracker
Companion Tracker is an android application that enables a user to get various suggestions for a suitable roommate based on all his/her preferences. One can like or dislike these suggestions based on their preferences. Our application also helps the user to interact with his/her matched persons using a personal messaging functionality. Once if a user dislikes a suggestion, the person will be removed from his list and will not be shown again. The users can also find a room in their desired location based on their preferences.
